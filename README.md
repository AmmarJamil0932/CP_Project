# Bank Management System (C++)

This is a C++ console-based project designed to simulate a simple bank management system. It allows users to create and manage bank accounts, process transactions, calculate zakat, and display account details.

## 📌 Project Overview

As part of our academic project at Bahria University (Islamabad Campus), we developed this system to understand how core banking operations can be managed through programming. The system provides a basic, user-friendly interface for bank staff or users to perform common banking operations.

## 🎯 Features

- Customer registration and account creation
- Deposit and withdrawal of funds
- Zakat calculation for eligible accounts
- Account summary and report generation
- Secure transaction processing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio
- **Platform:** Windows

## 💻 Requirements

### Hardware
- Intel Core i5 or i7 (10th gen recommended)
- 4–16 GB RAM
- 80 GB to 1 TB Hard Disk

### Software
- Windows 8, 10, or 11
- Visual Studio with C++ support

## 📋 Functional Modules

1. **Create Account** – Open a new account for the user  
2. **Deposit** – Add funds to an account  
3. **Withdraw** – Withdraw funds from an account  
4. **Report** – View account details including name and balance  
5. **Zakat** – Automatically calculate zakat for eligible balances

- Final account summaries displayed to the user

## ✅ Conclusion

This system helps simulate how a basic bank backend might operate. While simplified, it includes important features like security, accuracy, and efficiency in managing customer accounts and transactions. It's a great project to understand object-oriented programming and practical C++ applications.
